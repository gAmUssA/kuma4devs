== Setting up the Kuma Service Mesh Control Plane

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up the Kuma service mesh control plane using `kumactl`, the command-line interface (CLI) for Kuma.
We'll start by downloading and installing `kumactl`, and finally deploying Kuma to our Kubernetes cluster.

=== Step 1: Install kumactl (if not already installed)

To install `kumactl`, follow the link:https://kuma.io/docs/2.2.x/production/install-kumactl/[official kumactl installation guide] for your specific operating system.
Once installed, you can verify the installation by running:
You should see the version information for `kumactl`.

[source,bash]
----
> kumactl version

Client: Kuma 2.2.0
Unable to connect to control plane: Get "http://localhost:5681/": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:5681: connect: connection refused
----


=== Step 2: Deploy Kuma Control Plane to Kubernetes Cluster

With `kumactl` installed, we can now deploy the Kuma control plane to our Kubernetes cluster.
First, create a new namespace for Kuma:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace kuma-system
----

Next, use `kumactl` to install Kuma in the `kuma-system` namespace:

[source,bash]
----
kumactl install control-plane | kubectl apply -f -
----

This command generates Kubernetes manifests for the Kuma control plane components and applies them to your cluster within the `kuma-system` namespace.

=== Step 3: Verify Kuma Control Plane Deployment

After deploying the Kuma control plane, verify that all components are running successfully:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n kuma-system

NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
kuma-control-plane-79cbbd88cb-j6jnh   1/1     Running   1 (96s ago)   4d4h
----

You should see a list of pods related to Kuma, and their status should be `Running`.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the Kuma service mesh control plane using `kumactl`.
In the next section, we'll deploy Java demo applications and connect them to the service mesh.

[source,bash]
.Port Forwarding into Kuma pod
----
kubectl port-forward svc/kuma-control-plane -n kuma-system 5681:5681 
----

and open your browser http://localhost:5681/gui/
