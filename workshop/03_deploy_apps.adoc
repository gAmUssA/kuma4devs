== Deploying Demo Applications Using Kustomize

In this section, we will deploy the demo applications - Meeting and Work - using Kustomize, a native configuration management tool in Kubernetes. 

=== Overview of Kustomize

Kustomize allows you to define Kubernetes resources in a template-free way, enabling you to create variations of resources over different environments or stages in a Kubernetes native way. 

NOTE: It's built into `kubectl` and does not require any additional installations, unlike Helm or Skaffold.
The trade-off is that Kustomize may not be as feature-rich or flexible as Helm, which offers capabilities like packaging and sharing charts or managing releases. 
However, for our workshop, Kustomize offers sufficient functionality with a simpler setup. 

=== Step 1: Create Namespace with Enabled Label for Sidecar Injection

First, we need to create a namespace where our demo applications will be deployed. 
This namespace will have a label that enables automatic injection of Kuma sidecar proxies:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace mesh4devs
kubectl label namespace mesh4devs kuma.io/sidecar-injection=enabled
----

This creates a new namespace called `mesh4java` and adds a label to it to enable sidecar injection.

=== Step 2: Deploy Demo Applications

Assuming that you have a directory structure where the base manifests for your Work and Meeting applications are located in `kubernetes`, you can use Kustomize to deploy these applications:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -k ./kubernetes -n mesh4devs
----

=== Step 3: Verify Deployment

After deploying the demo applications, verify that they are running successfully:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n mesh4devs
----

You should see a list of pods related to the Spring Boot and Micronaut applications, and their status should be `Running`.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the Spring Boot and Micronaut demo applications using Kustomize.
