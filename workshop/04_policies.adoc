== Connecting Demo Applications to the Service Mesh and Enabling Traffic Policies

In this section, we'll connect the Spring Boot and Micronaut demo applications to the Kuma service mesh and enable various traffic policies such as routing, load balancing, mTLS encryption, and rate limiting.

=== Step 1: Verify Demo Applications are Connected to the Service Mesh

After deploying the demo applications with sidecar injection enabled, verify that they are connected to the Kuma service mesh:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get dataplanes -n mesh4java
----

You should see a list of dataplanes representing the demo applications, indicating that they are connected to the service mesh.

=== Step 2: Enable Mesh HTTP Route Policy

Create a traffic routing policy to split traffic between the Spring Boot (meeting) and Micronaut (work) demo applications:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: MeshHTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: http-route-1
  namespace: kuma-system
  labels:
    kuma.io/mesh: default
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: MeshService
    name: work_mesh4java_svc_8081
  to:
    - targetRef:
        kind: MeshService
        name: meeting_mesh4java_svc_8080
      rules:
        - matches:
            - path:
                type: Exact
                value: /meet
          default:
            filters:
              - type: RequestHeaderModifier
                requestHeaderModifier:
                  set:
                    - name: x-work-header
                      value: micronaut
----

Apply the traffic routing policy to the `mesh4java` namespace:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f mesh-route-add-header.yaml -n mesh4java
----

This policy adds extra custom header `x-kuma-header` to all request to `meeting` service.

=== Step 3: Enable mTLS Encryption

Create a Mesh resource to enable mTLS encryption for the service mesh:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: Mesh
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    enabledBackend: ca-1
    backends:
      - name: ca-1
        type: builtin
        dpCert:
          rotation:
            expiration: 1d
        conf:
          caCert:
            RSAbits: 2048
            expiration: 10y
----

Apply the Mesh resource:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f mtls.yaml
----

This configuration enables mTLS encryption using a built-in certificate authority (CA).

=== Step 4: Enable Rate Limiting Policy

Create a rate limiting policy to limit the number of requests per second (RPS) to the demo applications:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: MeshRateLimit
metadata:
  name: meeting-rate-limit
  namespace: kuma-system
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: MeshService
    name: meeting_mesh4java_svc_8080
  from:
    - targetRef:
        kind: Mesh
      default:
        local:
          http:
            requestRate:
              num: 3
              interval: 10s
            onRateLimit:
              status: 423
              headers:
                add:
                  - name: "x-kuma-rate-limited"
                    value: "true"
----

Apply the rate limiting policy to the `mesh4java` namespace:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f mesh-ratelimit.yaml -n mesh4java
----

This policy limits incoming requests to 3 RPS (only 3 meetings) and allows exceeding requests to pass through.

Congratulations! 
You have successfully connected the demo applications to the Kuma service mesh and enabled various traffic policies.
In the next section, we'll explore observability features by using Grafana and Prometheus.
