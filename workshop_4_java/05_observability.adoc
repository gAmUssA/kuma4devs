== Exploring Observability Features with Grafana and Prometheus

In this section, we'll explore the observability features offered by Kuma, including metrics and monitoring, by using Grafana and Prometheus. 
We'll enable observability using `kumactl` and then access the Grafana dashboard to visualize the collected metrics.

=== Step 1: Enable Observability with kumactl

To enable observability in Kuma, install the observability components using `kumactl`:

[source,bash]
----
kumactl install observability | kubectl apply -f -
----

This command generates Kubernetes manifests for the observability components, including Grafana and Prometheus, and applies them to your cluster within the `kuma-system` namespace.

=== Step 2: Verify Observability Components Deployment

After deploying the observability components, verify that all components are running successfully:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n mesh-observability
----

You should see a list of pods related to Kuma, Grafana, and Prometheus, and their status should be `Running`.

=== Step 3: Expose Grafana Service

To access the Grafana dashboard, expose the Grafana service using port forwarding:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl port-forward svc/kuma-grafana -n kuma-system 3000:80
----

This command maps the Grafana service's port 80 to your local machine's port 3000.

=== Step 4: Access Grafana Dashboard

With the Grafana service exposed, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

You will see the Grafana login page. The default credentials for Grafana are:

- Username: admin
- Password: admin

After logging in, you will see the Kuma Grafana dashboard, which displays various metrics related to the service mesh, such as request rate, latency, and error rate.

Feel free to explore the Grafana dashboard and its various panels to gain insights into the performance and health of your demo applications within the Kuma service mesh.

Congratulations! 
You have successfully enabled observability in Kuma using Grafana and Prometheus. 
With these powerful tools, you can monitor and visualize the performance of your service mesh and gain valuable insights into your application's behavior.
