== Requirements for Attendees

To make the most out of the "Service Mesh for Java developers" workshop, attendees are expected to meet the following requirements:

. *Basic knowledge of Java development*:
Attendees should be familiar with Java programming concepts and have experience working with Java-based frameworks such as Spring Boot and Micronaut.

. *Familiarity with containerization*:
A basic understanding of Docker and containerization concepts is essential, as the workshop will involve deploying Java applications within containers.

. *Experience with Kubernetes*:
Attendees should have a working knowledge of Kubernetes, including concepts like clusters, nodes, deployments, and services.
Prior experience using Minikube or KIND (Kubernetes IN Docker) for local Kubernetes development is strongly recommended.

. *Understanding of service mesh concepts*:
A basic understanding of service mesh architecture and its benefits will help attendees grasp the workshop material more effectively.
Prior knowledge of service mesh technologies (Istio, Kuma, Linkerd, etc.) is a plus but optional, as attendees will receive an introduction to the service mesh pattern during the workshop.

. *Pre-installed software and tools*:
Ensure that the following tools are installed and set up on your local machine before attending the workshop:
- link:https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker (latest version)]
- link:https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[Minikube (latest version)]
- link:https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/[KIND (latest version)]
- link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[Kubectl (latest version)]
- link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm (latest version)]
- link:https://jdk.java.net/17/[Java Development Kit (JDK) 17]
- link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition or existing license for Enterprise Edition; Community Edition is sufficient)]
- link:https://k9scli.io/topics/install/[K9s Kubernetes client (latest version)]
- link:http://https://insomnia.rest/download[Insomnia]

. *Laptop with an appropriate operating system*:
Attendees should bring a laptop with a Linux or macOS operating system, at least 8 GB of RAM, and a modern multicore processor to run the necessary tools and applications during the workshop.
Ensure that you have a stable internet connection for the workshop's duration.

NOTE: For Windows laptop users, unfortunately, we don't have access to Windows machines to validate all the instructions.
If you bring a Windows laptop, ensure you have appropriate rights to install software like Docker or Minikube.
Please be aware that the workshop experience might not be as seamless as using a Linux or macOS operating system.

. *Active participation*:
Attendees are expected to actively engage in hands-on exercises and discussions throughout the workshop to maximize learning and gain practical experience with service mesh technologies.

NOTE: Grafana and Prometheus will be installed during the workshop, so there is no need to pre-install them on your local machine.

By meeting these requirements, attendees will be well-prepared to participate in the "Service Mesh for Java developers" workshop, enhancing their understanding of service mesh technologies and their benefits for Java/JVM developers.
