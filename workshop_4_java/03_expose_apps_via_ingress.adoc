== *Optional*: Installing Kong Ingress Controller and Enabling Kuma Sidecar Injection

In this section, we will install the Kong Ingress Controller using Helm and enable the label for Kuma sidecar injection. 
We will also discuss the pros and cons of using Kong Ingress Controller compared to the default Kubernetes Ingress Controller (such as NGINX).

=== Pros and Cons of Kong Ingress Controller vs. Default Kubernetes Ingress Controller

*Pros:*

- Advanced API gateway features, such as authentication, rate limiting, and request/response transformations
- Native integration with Kuma for service mesh and ingress management
- Support for multiple protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and TLS)
- Extensible with custom plugins
- Active community and commercial support available

*Cons:*

- Additional complexity compared to the default Kubernetes Ingress Controller
- Requires learning Kong-specific configuration and concepts

=== Step 1: Add the Kong Helm Repository

First, add the Kong Helm repository to your Helm client:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add kong https://charts.konghq.com
helm repo update
----

This command adds the Kong Helm repository and updates your Helm client with the latest chart versions.

=== Step 2: Install Kong Ingress Controller Using Helm

To install the Kong Ingress Controller using Helm, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace kong
kubectl label namespace kong kuma.io/sidecar-injection=enabled  #<1>
----
<1> This command adds the sidecar injection label to the `kong` namespace, ensuring that Kuma injects sidecar proxies for all pods in the namespace.

[source,bash]
----
helm install kong kong/kong 
----

This command installs the Kong Ingress Controller with the Ingress controller enabled.

=== Step 3: Verify Kong Ingress Controller Deployment

After deploying the Kong Ingress Controller, verify that all components are running successfully:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n kong
----

You should see a list of pods related to the Kong Ingress Controller, and their status should be `Running`.

Congratulations! 
You have successfully installed the Kong Ingress Controller and enabled Kuma sidecar injection. 
By using Kong as your Ingress controller, you can take advantage of its advanced API gateway features and native integration with Kuma service mesh.

== Configuring Kubernetes Ingress for Work App

In this section, we will configure a Kubernetes Ingress resource for the Work Service microservice, allowing external traffic to access the service through the Kong Ingress Controller.

=== Step 1: Create a Kubernetes Ingress Resource

Create a Kubernetes Ingress resource for the Work microservice with the following YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: mesh4java.kongme.sh
  name: work
  namespace: mesh4java
spec:
  ingressClassName: kong
  rules:
    - host: mesh4java.kongme.sh
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              service:
                name: work
                port:
                  number: 8081
----

This Ingress resource specifies that external traffic should be routed to the Work microservice when accessing the `/` path.

The `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation indicates that the Kong Ingress Controller should manage this Ingress resource.

Save this YAML as `ingress.yaml`.

=== Step 2: Apply the Ingress Resource

Apply the Ingress resource to the `demo-apps` namespace:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml -n mesh4java
----

This command creates the Ingress resource for the Work microservice.

=== Step 3: Verify Ingress Resource Creation

Verify that the Ingress resource has been created:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get ingress -n mesh4java
----

You should see the `work` resource listed, indicating that it has been created successfully.

Congratulations! You have successfully configured a Kubernetes Ingress resource for the Work microservice. 
Now, external traffic can access the service through the Kong Ingress Controller by using the `/` path.
