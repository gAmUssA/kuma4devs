== Workshop Recap and Next Steps

As we conclude this workshop, let's recap what we've covered:

- We introduced service mesh and its benefits for Java developers
- We set up the Kuma service mesh control plane using `kumactl`
- We deployed Java demo applications built with Spring Boot and Micronaut using Skaffold
- We connected the demo applications to the service mesh and enabled various traffic policies
- We explored observability features using Grafana and Prometheus

We also recommend learning about Ingress controllers and how they can be integrated with service mesh to manage incoming traffic to your cluster.
