Hello and welcome to the "Service Mesh for Java Developers" workshop.
Service mesh is a powerful pattern for managing communication between microservices in a distributed system.
It decouples networking concerns from application code, making developing, deploying, and managing your services more manageable.
As Java developers, you might be familiar with some of these networking functionalities many Java frameworks provide.
However, adopting a service mesh can unlock even more capabilities and improve your applications' security, reliability, and observability.
