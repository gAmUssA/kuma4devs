Hello and welcome to the "Getting Started with Service Mesh" workshop.
Service mesh is a powerful pattern for managing communication between microservices in a distributed system.
It decouples networking concerns from application code, making developing, deploying, and managing your services more manageable.
As a developer, you might be familiar with some of these networking functionalities many frameworks toolkits provide.
However, adopting a service mesh can unlock even more capabilities and improve your applications' security, reliability, and observability.
